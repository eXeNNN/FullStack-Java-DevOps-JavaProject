# FullStack-Java-DevOps-JavaProject

Fullstack Java project that facilitates profile management.
With this application it is possible to create a user type (administrator, commercial ...), to create a user, to list the user type and the users.

This application is desgined using SpringBoot (backend, folder JavaProject) to create a MySQL database and the options of removing, editing and viewing users 
and user's types. Hibernate annotations are used too.

The front end (folder angularclient) is designed using Angular. Bootstrap is used in this proyect too.

Docker is NOT used due to conflicts with the versions.


ALL the requirements of the project are met but there's only one that is not: the connection between tables (user and type user).
